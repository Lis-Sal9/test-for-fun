# TEST FOR FUN

The installation is truly easy. You have to download / clone the repository. To do that, click the green button on the main page of the repository if you want to do it manually or execute this command on console from the directory where you want to clone it:
  git clone https://github.com//Lis-Sal9/test-for-fun

Next, you have to open on any browser the index.html of the project. Then, you will see the single web page I have done using Rick and Morty API. 

This code is made with pure Javascript and uses JQuery and Bootstrap libraries. Also, the project is distributed by folders for CSS, JS and images. The main page is in the root. I have implemented the base components,the pagination and the hover effect on gender bar chart, but the search bar is not finished yet.

Hope you enjoy it!
